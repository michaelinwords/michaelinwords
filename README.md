- 👋 Hi, I’m @michaelinwords
- 👀 I’m interested in creating the future of language and education technology, building tools that further access, deepen learning, and connect language communities.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about ML (machine learning) and NLP (natural language processing), how computers interface with human language.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects with a clear vision (especially service-oriented) and which improve society - I'm interested in a lot (including Unity game dev)!
- 📫 How to reach me: email through michaelinwords@gmail.com or LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/amanimichael/...
