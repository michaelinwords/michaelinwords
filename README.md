- 👋 Hi, I’m @michaelinwords
- 👀 I’m interested in creating the future of language technology, especially building tools that further access, deepen learning, and connect marginalised communities.
- 🌱 I am skilled in ML (machine learning) and NLP (natural language processing) application development, for which I primarily use Python, C#, and Javascript.  I am familiar with the latest tooling in LLMs, such as HuggingFace, GPT, and Langchain pipelines.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects with a clear vision (especially service-oriented) and which improve society.
- 📫 How to reach me: email through michaelinwords@gmail.com or LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/amanimichael/...
